# GPT Tools - LangChain

LangChain is a framework designed to build applications powered by language models (like GPT). It provides tools to chain together prompts, integrate with external data, and create agentic workflows.

## Key Concepts in LangChain

### Prompt
A prompt is the input given to a language model to generate a response. It can be a simple question or a more structured instruction.

**Example**:  
"Translate the following English text to French: 'Hello, how are you?'"

### Prompt Chain
A prompt chain involves linking multiple prompts together to achieve a more complex task. The output of one prompt becomes the input for the next.

**Example**:  
1. First prompt extracts key information from a text.  
2. Second prompt summarizes that information.

### Prompt Template
A prompt template is a reusable structure for prompts, often with placeholders for dynamic content.

**Example**:  
"Summarize the following text: {text}", where `{text}` is replaced with actual content.

### Chunking
Chunking refers to breaking down large pieces of text or data into smaller, manageable chunks. This is useful for processing large documents with language models that have token limits.

**Example**:  
Splitting a long article into sections for summarization.

### Retrieval
Retrieval involves fetching relevant information from a dataset or knowledge base to augment the language model's responses.

**Example**:  
Using a vector database to retrieve relevant documents for a query.

## Agents & Tools

### Agents
Agents in LangChain are systems that use language models to decide actions and interact with external tools or APIs.

### Tools
Tools are functions or APIs that agents can use to perform tasks (e.g., search the web, query a database, or execute code).

**Example**:  
- An agent uses a calculator tool to solve math problems.  
- A search tool is used to find real-time information.

### Agentic Frameworks
Agentic frameworks are systems where agents autonomously perform tasks by making decisions and using tools.

**Example**:  
A customer support agent that:
- Retrieves FAQs.  
- Answers questions.  
- Escalates issues to a human if needed.

## Integrations

### HuggingFace
HuggingFace is a popular platform for natural language processing (NLP) that provides pre-trained models, datasets, and tools.

LangChain integrates with HuggingFace models, allowing you to use them in your workflows.

**Example**:  
Using HuggingFace's transformers library to load a model for text generation.

### LangSmith
LangSmith is a tool provided by LangChain for debugging, testing, and monitoring language model applications. It helps developers trace the execution of prompts, chains, and agents to improve performance and reliability.

### LangGraph
LangGraph is a newer addition to the LangChain ecosystem, designed for building more complex, graph-based workflows.

It allows you to create directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of tasks, where nodes represent prompts, tools, or agents, and edges define the flow of data.
